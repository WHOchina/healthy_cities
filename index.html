  <h2>Overview of the Healtly Cities Project</h2>
  <p>
     WHO Healthy Cities is a global movement working to put health high on the social, economic and political agenda of city governments.
     A healthy city is one that is continually creating and improving those physical and social environments and expanding those community 
     resources which enable people to mutually support each other in performing all the functions of life and developing to their 
     maximum potential. In this policy advocacy package we will specifically be looking at Age-friendly cities, tobaccao laws, primary health care,
     road safety, and salt and sugar reduction.
